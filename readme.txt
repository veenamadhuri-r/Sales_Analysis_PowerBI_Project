Sales Analysis Power BI Project

This Power BI project focuses on sales analysis. The project aims to provide insights into the sales performance and market trends of a company that has stores across India. This contains several key tables: Customers, Dates, Products, Transactions, and Markets.

      The project leverages these tables to create interactive visualizations, dashboards, and reports that offer valuable insights into store-level sales performance and market dynamics. Key features of the project include:

- Sales trends over time: Visualizations that display sales performance and revenue trends across various periods and enable the examination of growth patterns.
- Store performance analysis: Utilizing store information to identify and analyze sales performance at the store level.
- Product analysis: Visualizations that provide insights into the top-selling products across stores, product performance over time, and the contribution of each product to overall sales.
- Market comparison: Interactive charts that allow for the comparison of sales across different cities or markets.

By analyzing the data and exploring the visualizations within this Power BI project, users can understand sales performance, identify growth opportunities, and make informed business decisions to drive revenue and profitability.
